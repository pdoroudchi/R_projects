## Watermelon Cucumber Salad Recipe

**Ingredients:**

* About 1/4 a large seedless watermelon or 1 small (mini) watermelon
* 2 small (Perisan-style) seedless cucumber, thinly sliced
* 8 ounces ricotta salata, cut into matchsticks
* 1/4 cup toasted, salted pepitas (hulled pumpkin seeds)
* Olive oil, for drizzling
* Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper

_Special_ kitchen tools:

* Large platter

**Steps:**

1. For small watermelon, halve it and then place each half cut side down and cut each half into 8 pie-like slices
2. Remove the rinds from each and cut each wedge into 1/2-inch thick triangles  
3. On a large platter, scatter a thick layer of watermelon triangles, followed by a thinner scattering of cucumbers, ricotta salata matchsticks and pepitas
4. Drizzle lightly with olive oil and season with salt and pepper
5. Repeat this rustic layering and seasoning until your ingredients are used up, finishing with an extra generous drizzle of olive oil
6. Eat at once!

This easy recipe is ideal for the warmest of summer days!

Here are a few subtle variations one could make:

* Add some fresh slivered mint leaves and/or razor-thin slivers of red onion
* Substitute the ricotta salata machsticks with crumbled feta cheese

## Euclidean Distance

#### Definition [edit]

---

The **Euclidean Distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them \(\mathbf{\overline{pq}}\).

In Cartesian coordinates, if \(\mathbf{p} = (p_1, p_2, ... , p_n)\) and \(\mathbf{q} = ( q_1, q_2,..., q_n)\) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

\[ \begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathit{d}(\mathbf{p, q}) = \mathit{d}(\mathbf{q, p}) & = \sqrt{(q_1 - p_1)^2 + (q_2 - p_2)^2 + ... + (q_n - p_n)^2} \\
 & = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} (q_i - p_i)^2}.
\end{split}
\end{equation} \]

The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

\[ \| p \| = \sqrt{p_1^2 + p_2^2 + ... + p_n^2} = \sqrt{\mathbf{p \cdot p}}, \]

where the last expression involves the dot product.
