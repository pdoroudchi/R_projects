## Description

In the third and final workout we create an R package named `"binomial"`, a somewhat basic yet useful package that provides tools for calculating and vizualizing a Binomial distribution.     

## Motivation

The assignment allows us to better understand the workings of a package, which is perhaps the most fundamental part of R. We are tasked with building private functions that help check the public functions and also draft all of the relevant documentation required for publshing a package.

## File Structure

`"binomial"` is divided into several folders, such as `R/`, `man/`, `tests/`, and `vignettes/`, which are fundamental folders for building any R package.
