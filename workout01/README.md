## Description

We begin workout 01 by downloading five CSV files containing data pertaining to shot attempts made by Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. We manipulate these data frames through R, extract summary statistics, and eventually bind the data frames into one global table in order to create a facetted shot chart of said players in order to present the data in an accessible and understandable format. Finally, we create an article-style report to explore the statitics and include efficiency shooting percentage tables as well as the facetted shot chart to support our analysis.  

## Motivation

For the report part of the workout, I decided to pit the shooting statistics of the '16-17 Warriors up against the '95-96 Chicago Bulls in order to find which is the greatest NBA team of all-time. 

## File Structure

Workout 01 is divided into several folders, such as code, data, images, output, and the report. The structure is well-organized and allows for the use of relative paths to ensure reproducibility of the project.
