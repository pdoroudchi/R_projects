In workout 1, we begin by downloading five CSV files containing data pertaining to shot attempts made by Andre Iguodala, Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors. We manipulate these data frames through R and extract summary statistics and eventually bind the data frames into one global table in order to create what we really want: individual and facetted shot charts of said players that include a basketball court background and various visual attributes in order to present the data beautifully and accessibly. Finally, we create an article-style report to delve into the details behind the numbers and include tables regarding shooting percentages and the facetted shot chart created earlier to drive our point home.
